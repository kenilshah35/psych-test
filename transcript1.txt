[START OF TRANSCRIPT]

Dr. Mitchell: Good morning, James. It's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

James: Morning, Dr. Mitchell. Um, I guess... it's been a bit of a roller coaster. Some days are fine, others... not so much. Mostly feeling kind of stuck.

Dr. Mitchell: That sounds like a tough place to be. When you say “stuck,” can you help me understand what that feels like for you?

James: Yeah. Like, I wake up, and I already feel behind. My thoughts start racing—what did I forget to do? What deadline did I miss? It's like I'm constantly bracing for something bad. And even on weekends, I can’t switch it off.

Dr. Mitchell: That level of constant vigilance can be exhausting. Do you notice any physical symptoms when this happens?

James: Definitely. My chest tightens up, I clench my jaw, my stomach gets upset. Sometimes I even feel dizzy, like I can't get enough air. I used to think it was just caffeine or poor sleep, but it's more than that.

Dr. Mitchell: It sounds like you're describing symptoms consistent with anxiety—racing thoughts, somatic tension, and hypervigilance. How long has this been going on?

James: A couple of years, I think. It really ramped up during the pandemic. Working from home sounded like a break at first, but I ended up working longer hours. No boundaries. It hasn’t really stopped since.

Dr. Mitchell: That makes sense. Lack of boundaries, especially when working remotely, can feed into overworking, which in turn fuels anxiety. You’ve mentioned before that you’re a software engineer—do you still enjoy the work?

James: I used to. I liked solving problems, making things work. But now it just feels like I’m putting out fires. I don’t even get to focus. It’s meetings, emails, Slack messages all day. I’m always “on.”

Dr. Mitchell: So there's not much space for deep work or creativity anymore.

James: Exactly. And when I do get a break, I feel guilty. Like I should be doing more. It’s like I don’t know how to rest anymore.

Dr. Mitchell: That guilt... it sounds very internalized. Where do you think it comes from?

James: Probably childhood stuff. My dad was a military guy. Discipline was everything. If I got a B+, he’d say, “Why not an A?” There was always a higher bar.

Dr. Mitchell: And now that inner critic has taken over his job.

James: Yeah, pretty much. It's like he's in my head 24/7. Even though he’s not around much anymore, the voice is still loud.

Dr. Mitchell: That’s a powerful realization, James. Can we try something experiential? Let’s imagine that critical voice. Give it a name or a form. What comes to mind?

James: Huh... interesting. I guess I picture this stern, suit-wearing guy, arms crossed, tapping his foot like he's impatient.

Dr. Mitchell: Let’s call him “The Manager” for now. What does The Manager usually say to you?

James: Things like “You’re lazy,” “You’re wasting time,” or “You’ll fall behind if you stop.” He’s relentless.

Dr. Mitchell: And if you could speak back to The Manager—what would you want to say?

James: Maybe… “I’m doing my best,” or “Back off, I need space.” But it’s hard to believe those words, honestly.

Dr. Mitchell: That’s completely understandable. You’ve internalized his expectations for so long, it feels unsafe to challenge them. But even naming the voice and giving it a form is a big first step.

James: I never really thought of it like that before. Like, it’s a part of me, but not all of me.

Dr. Mitchell: Exactly. It’s a part of you, developed for protection and achievement. But now, it's overfunctioning and causing harm. Let’s try something: What would it be like to introduce another voice—one that’s compassionate?

James: That’s hard. I don’t think I’ve ever developed that voice. It’s always been criticism or silence.

Dr. Mitchell: Could we borrow the voice of someone in your life who’s been kind to you? A friend, teacher, or mentor?

James: Hmm... maybe my grandma. She passed away a few years ago. She used to say, “Take it slow, honey. The world’s not running away.” She always made me feel calm.

Dr. Mitchell: That’s beautiful. Let’s imagine your grandmother sitting beside you. What would she say when The Manager starts berating you?

James: She’d probably smile and say, “Don’t listen to him. You’ve done more than enough for one day.”

Dr. Mitchell: How does that feel in your body when you hear her voice?

James: Softer. My shoulders just relaxed. I didn’t even realize they were so tense. It's like I can breathe again.

Dr. Mitchell: That’s the power of self-compassion. It's not indulgence—it's a way of balancing that harsh inner voice with something nurturing. We can explore building that voice more intentionally in the coming weeks.

James: I’d like that. I think I need it.

Dr. Mitchell: You absolutely do. Let’s shift a bit. Earlier you mentioned feeling “stuck.” What does that word mean in the broader sense—career, relationships, purpose?

James: All of the above? Career feels like a treadmill. My relationships... I’ve been isolating. I haven’t really dated since my last breakup, almost two years ago. I don’t even see my friends that much.

Dr. Mitchell: Isolation can become a protective shell when we’re overwhelmed, but it also deepens loneliness. Do you want to reconnect, or does it feel safer to be alone right now?

James: Both. I crave connection, but I also dread the effort. Like... I don’t have the energy to be present or interesting.

Dr. Mitchell: That’s depression talking. It tells you you’re unworthy of love or boring, when the truth is, you're burnt out and hurting. Not broken. Just in need of healing.

James: That actually hit me pretty hard. Not broken. That’s hard to believe, but I want to.

Dr. Mitchell: And that’s where we’ll do our work together. To help you believe that again. We’ll look at the distortions your brain throws at you—like “I’m boring,” “I’m lazy”—and we’ll challenge them gently. Bit by bit.

James: Sounds like a long road.

Dr. Mitchell: It is. But you won’t walk it alone. Can I ask—what would a small step forward look like for you this week? Something kind and doable?

James: Maybe texting a friend I’ve been avoiding. Just to say hey.

Dr. Mitchell: That’s a beautiful start. No pressure to make plans or explain anything—just reach out. Reopening the door.

James: Yeah. I think I can do that.

Dr. Mitchell: Good. And when you do, notice how it feels—before, during, and after. We’ll reflect on it next session. I’d also like to suggest a small journaling practice. Nothing formal—just 5 minutes a day to write whatever comes up. Even just feelings or words. Would that feel okay?

James: I can try. I might miss a day or two, but I’ll give it a shot.

Dr. Mitchell: That’s all I ask. We’re not aiming for perfection. Just presence. Before we wrap up, any final thoughts or feelings you'd like to share?

James: I feel... lighter. Tired, but lighter. Like I’ve been carrying a heavy bag and finally put it down for a second.

Dr. Mitchell: That image is powerful. That’s the goal of therapy—not to make the bag disappear overnight, but to help you carry it with more ease. Or eventually, unpack what’s inside.

James: Thanks, Dr. Mitchell. Really.

Dr. Mitchell: You’re very welcome, James. I’ll see you next week, same time?

James: Yeah. See you then.
